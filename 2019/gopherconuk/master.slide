* Is GO an Object Oriented Language?

- Encapsulation (possible on package level in Go)
- Composition (possible through embedding in Go)
- Polymorphism (possible through Interface satisfaction in Go)
- Inheritance (not supported, considered a bad practice)

* Is GO an Object Oriented Language?

Encapsulation

.code java2go.go /START 1/,/END 1/

* Is GO an Object Oriented Language?

Composition (embedding)

.code java2go.go /START 2/,/END 2/

(cont...)

* Is GO an Object Oriented Language?

Embedding is not sub-classing

.play embedding.go

* Is GO an Object Oriented Language?

Polymorphism

.code java2go.go /START 4/,/END 4/

Above, r.Read will be dispatched to (*Buffer).Read.

* The go type system for newcomers

* Embedding is not inheritance

Consider the following struct:

.code java2go.go /START 3.1/,/END 3.1/

Then, File objects will directly have access to sync.Mutex methods:

.code java2go.go /START 3.2/,/END 3.2/

This is not sub-classing!!
